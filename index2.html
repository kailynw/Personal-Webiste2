<div id="bio" align="center">About Me</div>
<div id="paragraph" align="center">For those who don't know me, my name is Kailyn Williams. I am from Inman, SC, but currently living in Lyman, SC. Presently, I am a recent graduate from Spartanburg Methodist College with my Associates of Science. During my time at Spartanburg Methodist, I had partaken in many leadership activities and clubs that have enhanced my skills and expanded my knowledge in a diverse way. Some of the clubs that I was involved in were Kappa Sigma Alpha Service Fraternity (Vice President) and Business Entrepreneur Club. Additionally, I plan on transferring to the University of South Carolina Upstate to finish school and obtain my Bachelors of Computer Science degree and become a Software Developer.</div>
